# Planet Prestige

- This is my first cybersecurity lab, where I learned how to analyze a suspicious email. I opened a raw email file, checked the headers, and found signs of spoofing. This lab helped me understand the basics of phishing analysis and how a SOC analyst investigates suspicious messages.

## What I did

- First I opened the raw email file with notepad ++ and quickly identified the spoofed sender information and the other suspicious content.
