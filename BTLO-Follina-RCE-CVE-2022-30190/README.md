## Overview

## Tools Used

## SHA1 Hash Value
In this lab, I investigated a malicious Word document. My first task was to obtain the file's SHA1 hash value. I used PowerShell to gather the SHA1 hash value of the sample.

I used the PowerShell command to get the hash value 

Get-fileHash "C:\Users\iman\Desktop\43eecf22e8f914d44df3da16c23dcc2e076a8753\sample\sample.doc" -Alogrithm SHA1 >

## Virus Total File Type Analysis
I used VirusTotal to identify the full file type of the malicious document. The filetype is "Office Open XML Document."

## Extracting the URL
I used Notepad++ to identify the malicious URL.

### URL
- https://www.xmlformats.com/office/word/2022/wordprocessingDrawing/RDF842l.html

### Why is this  Malicious?
The above URL is malicious because it is used to load an external website; normal Word documents typically do not load external websites. Even the domain of this URL is fake, and the attacker tried to make it look like it belongs to Microsoft.
